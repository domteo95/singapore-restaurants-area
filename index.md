## Which areas in Singapore have the best restaurants

### Overview

A more thorough explanation of how the datasets were created can be found (here)[https://github.com/domteo95/singapore-restaurants-area/].

Using a TripAdvisor crawler that I wrote as well as a Yelp dataset generated by Sean Koh for his group project which can be found (here)[https://wonkishtofu.shinyapps.io/FoodScrapers/], I have a combined dataset that after removing for duplicates have 14,042 different restaurants around Singapore. 

I then utilize the geojson file which contains the polygon geometries for each of Singapore's 55 (Planning Areas)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore]. Each individual planning area can then be further divided into subzones. In total, there are 55 planning areas which correspond to 332 different subzones as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). For example there are 3 subzones within the Bishan planning area - Bishan East, Upper Thomson and Marymount.

### Merged Datasets

I then merge the restaurants (TripAdvisor+Yelp) dataset with the boundaries (Subzones+Planning Area) dataset so that each row represents a unique restaurant that has the following information. 
- Name (of restaurant)
- primaryRating (from 0 to 5)
- reviewCount (number of Reviews for that restaurant)
- geometry (geometric point to identify location)
- Subzone Name
- Planning Area Name
